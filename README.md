## Part 1: Foundations of DevOps and Cloud Computing - Week 1-2

### What is DevOps?

#### üåü Introduction to DevOps and Its Impact

**Key Idea:**  
DevOps transforms the speed and efficiency of software delivery, turning tasks that took **hours or days** into ones completed in **minutes**.

**Explanation:**  
Traditionally, software development and deployment involved **siloed teams**, lengthy processes, and significant delays. DevOps introduces a **culture and set of practices** that unite development and operations, allowing companies to deliver updates faster and more reliably. This agility allows businesses to **focus more on their products and services**, which is why it's being rapidly adopted across industries.

---

#### üé® Emma‚Äôs Story ‚Äì Real-world Analogy

**Scenario:**  
Emma, an artist who owns a physical art gallery, wants to **expand online** through a mobile app.

**What She Needs:**
- A team of **developers** to build the app.
- **Testers** to ensure its quality.
- **Operations/admins** to host and maintain the app on servers.

**Explanation:**  
Emma's situation mirrors many modern businesses that wish to digitize their services. Since she doesn‚Äôt have a technical team, she partners with a software firm. Through her journey, we explore the **real-life application of DevOps principles** in a typical software development cycle.

---

#### üß± Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Phases of SDLC:**

1. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**  
   - Understanding what features the product should have.
   - How users will interact with it.
   - Research on market demand and competitive landscape.

2. **Planning**  
   - Estimating **cost**, **time**, and **resources** needed.
   - Identifying potential **risks**.

3. **Designing**  
   - Architects create technical blueprints and roadmaps for development.
   - These design documents guide developers in the coding phase.

4. **Development**  
   - Developers begin writing the actual software code.
   - This is often the most exciting and creative phase for devs.

5. **Testing**  
   - The software is thoroughly tested to catch bugs and issues.
   - It only moves forward once all defects are resolved.

6. **Deployment**  
   - The tested software is moved to the **production environment** where real users can interact with it.

7. **Maintenance**  
   - Keeping the app running smoothly.
   - Applying updates, fixing issues, and adapting to changes over time.

**Explanation:**  
This step-by-step process is structured and ensures quality. The operations team plays a critical role post-deployment, ensuring the software stays available and stable.

---

#### üîÑ Software Development Models

**1. Waterfall Model:**  
   - Each phase is done **sequentially**.
   - Once a phase is completed, you **can‚Äôt go back**.
   - Working software is seen **very late**, possibly months into development.
   - Not ideal if requirements are **uncertain or evolving**, like in Emma‚Äôs case.

**2. Agile Model:**  
   - Requirements are broken into **smaller tasks (sprints/iterations)**.
   - Iterations typically last **2 to 4 weeks**.
   - Each sprint delivers a **working prototype** or feature.
   - Stakeholders like Emma can give **frequent feedback**, helping shape the final product as it evolves.

**Explanation:**  
Agile offers **flexibility**. It‚Äôs best when clients are unsure about all features upfront, or when they may change ideas as the product takes shape.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges with Agile SDLC ‚Äì Developer vs. Operations

**Problem Emerges:**  
As development progresses using Agile, the **operations team (ops)** faces difficulties in keeping up:
- Code needs to be **frequently deployed** for testing.
- Testers sometimes **can‚Äôt access** the servers, or test cases fail.
- Deployment instructions may be **unclear** or miscommunicated.

**Explanation:**  
Agile demands **frequent updates**. The ops team is burdened by:
- Constant deployment requests.
- Managing server uptime.
- Fixing issues on short notice.

This leads to **missed deadlines**, frustration, and ultimately delays in product delivery ‚Äî making Emma (the client) unhappy.

---

#### üöß Wall Between Dev and Ops

**The Great Divide:**  
- **Developers** throw their code "over the wall".
- **Operations** team has to figure out how to deploy it.
- Devs complain about **slow deployments**.
- Ops complains about **poor instructions and pressure**.

**Real-world Consequences:**  
- **Delays and bugs** in production.
- **Unhappy customers** and **lost business**.
- Development and operations are **misaligned**, even though they‚Äôre on the same project.

**Analogy:**  
Developers are **Agile** ‚Äî quick and iterative.  
Operations are **ITIL (Waterfall)-driven** ‚Äî structured and stability-focused.  
This clash causes friction.

---

#### üöÄ Introduction to DevOps

**Reggie‚Äôs Realization:**  
Reggie, the director, identifies the root cause:  
Dev and Ops aren‚Äôt **collaborating effectively**.

**Solution: DevOps**  
- A **DevOps consultant** is brought in to unify and streamline the process.
- The goal isn‚Äôt magic ‚Äî it‚Äôs **collaboration, communication, and integration**.

---

#### üîß DevOps in Action ‚Äì Breaking the Wall

**Training and Culture Shift:**  
- **Developers** are trained in operations concepts (e.g., server behavior, deployment pipelines).
- **Operations** are trained in Agile concepts (e.g., iterations, sprints).
- Every team is introduced to **automation tools and techniques**.

**Automation in DevOps:**  
All key tasks are automated:
- **Code building**
- **Testing (unit and integration)**
- **Infrastructure provisioning**
- **Software deployment**

Automation ensures:
- **No human errors**
- **Faster and repeatable** delivery process

**Explanation:**  
Instead of handing things over blindly, both teams:
- **Work together**
- Use **automated pipelines**
- Share knowledge and responsibility

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Lifecycle ‚Äì Fully Automated Flow

**Key Features:**
- **No manual intervention**
- **Quick iterations**
- Everything is **integrated and streamlined**
- Ensures **consistency**, **efficiency**, and **rapid delivery**

**Outcome:**  
- Any request Emma makes can now be fulfilled **quickly**.
- Customers are **satisfied** with timely updates and a stable experience.
- Emma's idea has **successfully scaled into a thriving online business**.

---

#### üéâ Summary

**Before DevOps:**
- Siloed teams.
- Miscommunication.
- Delays in development and deployment.
- Frustrated stakeholders.

**After DevOps:**
- Seamless collaboration.
- Automated pipelines.
- Continuous delivery and integration.
- Happy customers and business growth.

---

### DevOps Principles, Practices, and Culture

- **Culture, automation, measurement, and sharing (CAMS)** are central principles.

---

### Docker ‚Äì Detailed Notes

#### Why was Docker Needed?

**Personal Experience Introduction:**

The speaker shares a real-world project scenario where they needed to build a complete application stack. It included various technologies like:

- NodeJS for the web server
- MongoDB as the database
- Redis for messaging
- An orchestration tool for coordination

**Challenges faced:**

- **OS Compatibility Issues:**
    
    Every component (NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, etc.) needed to be compatible with the operating system being used. Sometimes a version mismatch forced the team to look for another OS altogether.
    
- **Library and Dependency Conflicts:**
    
    Different services required different versions of the same libraries. This created conflicts and required constant management.
    
- **Changing Application Architecture:**
    
    As the application evolved ‚Äî upgrading databases or components ‚Äî the team had to repeatedly verify compatibility each time a change was made.
    
- **Developer Onboarding Difficulties:**
    
    Setting up a development environment for a new developer was tedious. They had to follow a long list of steps and manually configure everything correctly, including using the exact OS and component versions.
    
- **Environment Inconsistency:**
    
    Developers, testers, and production environments could differ (e.g., different operating systems), leading to problems where an app that worked in one environment failed in another.

**Conclusion:**

Managing the application lifecycle (development, building, shipping) became extremely painful.

Thus, a solution was needed that:

- Handled compatibility better
- Allowed isolated setups of services
- Provided easy setup for developers

**Discovery:**

This problem led the speaker to discover **Docker**.

---

#### How Docker Helped

- **Containers for Each Component:**
    
    Each application component was run inside its own **container**. Each container had its **own dependencies and libraries**.
    
- **One-Time Configuration:**
    
    The Docker setup was built once. Afterwards, developers only had to run a simple `docker run` command to spin up the required environment.
    
- **OS Independence:**
    
    As long as Docker was installed, it didn't matter what OS the developer was using. The container would work the same way everywhere.

---

#### What are Containers?

- **Isolated Environments:**
    
    A container is a completely isolated environment that has:
    
    - Its own processes and services
    - Its own network interfaces
    - Its own mounts
- **Difference from Virtual Machines:**
    
    Although they behave somewhat like VMs, **containers share the same OS kernel** of the host system, unlike VMs which require their own OS.
    
- **History:**
    
    Containers are not new ‚Äî technologies like **LXC, LXD, LXCFS** have existed for over a decade.
    
    Docker popularized containers by building a **high-level, user-friendly platform** on top of these low-level technologies.

---

#### Revisiting Operating System Concepts

- **Structure of an OS:**
    
    Any Linux-based OS (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, etc.) consists of:
    
    - **Kernel:** Manages hardware interactions.
    - **Software Stack:** Things like user interfaces, drivers, compilers, developer tools, etc.
- **Kernel Sharing in Containers:**
    
    Docker containers **share the host machine's kernel** but have their **own software stack** on top.
    
    Example:
    
    - An Ubuntu-based Docker host can run Debian, Fedora, or CentOS containers easily ‚Äî all of them use the Linux kernel.
- **Windows and Docker:**
    - **Problem:** Windows has a different kernel than Linux, so you **cannot natively** run Linux containers on Windows.
    - **Solution:** When Docker is installed on Windows, it **spins up a lightweight Linux Virtual Machine** internally to run Linux containers.
    
    Hence, Linux containers on Windows are actually Linux containers running inside a hidden Linux VM.

---

#### Containers vs Virtual Machines (VMs)

| Aspect | Containers | Virtual Machines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS | Share host OS kernel | Each VM has its own OS |
| Resource Usage | Lightweight (Megabytes) | Heavy (Gigabytes) |
| Boot Time | Seconds | Minutes |
| Isolation | Less strict (shared kernel) | Strong isolation |
| Flexibility | Run apps built for same kernel | Run apps built for different kernels (Linux/Windows) |

**Key Insight:**

Docker containers are **not a replacement** for VMs ‚Äî they complement each other.

In real-world deployments:

- Virtual machines are still used to host Docker containers.
- One VM may now host **hundreds or thousands** of lightweight containers instead of just one application.

---

#### How Applications are Deployed with Docker

- **Public Docker Hub:**
    
    Many common applications (OS images, databases, developer tools) are already containerized and available on Docker Hub (official repository).
    
- **Simple Deployment:**
    
    After installing Docker on a host, deploying applications becomes as simple as:
    
    ```bash
    docker run <image-name>
    ```
    
    Examples:
    
    - Run an instance of MongoDB
    - Run Redis
    - Run a NodeJS server
- **Scaling:**
    
    If more instances of a service are needed:
    
    - Simply spin up more containers.
    - Use a **load balancer** in front to distribute traffic.
- **Failure Handling:**
    
    If a container fails:
    
    - Destroy the bad container.
    - Launch a new one easily and quickly.

---

#### Images vs Containers

- **Image:**
    - A static template or package that contains the code, libraries, and dependencies.
    - Think of it like a VM template.
- **Container:**
    - A **running instance** of an image.
    - It's live, isolated, and has its own environment and processes.

**Creating Custom Images:**

If an organization needs something custom not found on Docker Hub:

- They can **build their own image**.
- Push it to Docker Hub (private or public).

---

#### Docker's Role in DevOps

- **Traditional Approach:**
    
    Developers built the application ‚Üí Gave it to Operations ‚Üí Ops struggled to set it up manually.
    
- **With Docker:**
    - Developers and Ops teams **collaborate** on a **Dockerfile**.
    - This Dockerfile includes all setup instructions and requirements.
    - A Docker Image is built from the Dockerfile.
    - The same image is used in development, testing, and production.

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates the "it worked on my machine" problem.
- Ensures consistency across environments.
- Speeds up deployment.

---

#### Docker Installation Guide

##### Step 1: Install Oracle VirtualBox

- Download and install **Oracle VirtualBox** from the official website.
- Install it on your **Windows laptop**.

##### Step 2: Create an Ubuntu VM

- Download an **Ubuntu ISO** (LTS version recommended, e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).
- Open VirtualBox and create a **new VM**:
    - Select "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu" as the version.
    - Allocate memory (RAM) and disk space.
- Attach the Ubuntu ISO in the VM settings ‚Üí **Storage** ‚Üí **Add ISO**.
- Boot the VM and install Ubuntu by following the on-screen instructions.

##### Step 3: Install Docker on Ubuntu

Open the **terminal** inside the Ubuntu VM and follow these steps:

1. **Update package index:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. **Install required packages:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    ```
    
3. **Add Docker's official GPG key:**
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```
    
4. **Set up the Docker repository:**
    
    ```bash
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```
    
5. **Update package index again (after adding Docker repo):**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
6. **Install Docker Engine:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install docker-ce
    ```

---

##### Step 4: Start Docker Service

- Start the Docker service:
    
    ```bash
    sudo service docker start
    ```
    
- (Optional) To enable Docker to start automatically on boot:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    ```

---

##### Step 5: Test Docker Installation

- Run the **hello-world** container:
    
    ```bash
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```
    
    - ‚úÖ Docker ran successfully with `sudo`.
- Try running without `sudo`:
    
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
    
    - ‚ùå **Error**: Permission denied (expected).

---

##### Step 6: Run Docker Without `sudo`

- Add your user to the `docker` group:
    
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    
- **Important:** After running the above command, **log out and log back in** (or restart the VM) so that group changes take effect.
- Now try running again:
    
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
    
    - ‚úÖ **Success!** Docker now works without `sudo`.

---

#### Basic Docker Commands

##### 1. Running a Docker Container

- Command:
    
    ```bash
    docker run <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run centos
    ```
    
- Behavior:
    - Docker checks if the image exists locally.
    - If not, Docker downloads (pulls) it from **Docker Hub**.
    - Official images (e.g., centos, ubuntu, nginx) can be pulled just by name.

---

##### 2. Running a Container with a Command

- To keep a container running (otherwise it exits immediately):
    - Provide a command like `bash` or `sleep`.
    - Example to open bash inside a CentOS container:
        
        ```bash
        docker run -it centos bash
        ```
        
    - `it` options:
        - `i`: Interactive mode (keeps STDIN open)
        - `t`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY (terminal)

---

##### 3. Listing Containers

- **List running containers**:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    
- **List all containers (running + exited)**:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

---

##### 4. Running Containers in Detached Mode

- Run containers in background (detached):
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d centos sleep 20
    ```
    
- `d`: Detached mode (container runs in background)
- Can still check them using `docker ps`.

---

##### 5. Stopping and Killing Containers

- **Stop a running container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker stop <container-name-or-ID>
    ```
    
- After stopping, container is listed as **Exited** in `docker ps -a`.
- Exit codes:
    - `0` ‚Üí Normal exit
    - `137` ‚Üí Force-stopped or killed

---

##### 6. Removing Containers

- **Remove one container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker rm <container-name-or-ID>
    ```
    
- **Remove multiple containers**:
    
    ```bash
    docker rm <container-ID-1> <container-ID-2> <container-ID-3>
    ```
    
- Tip: You don't have to type the full ID, just the first few characters.

---

##### 7. Viewing Docker Images

- **List downloaded images**:
    
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```
    
- Displays:
    - Repository
    - Tag
    - Image ID
    - Size

---

##### 8. Removing Docker Images

- **Remove an image**:
    
    ```bash
    docker rmi <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Note**:
    
    You cannot delete an image if containers are still using it.
    
    - First, remove the containers:
        
        ```bash
        docker rm <container-ID>
        ```
        
    - Then remove the image.

---

##### 9. Pulling an Image without Running It

- **Pull image only** (without running):
    
    ```bash
    docker pull <image-name>
    ```

---

##### 10. Quick Notes on Image Repositories

- **Official images**:
    - Pulled directly by name (e.g., `centos`, `ubuntu`).
- **Personal or custom images**:
    - Use format:
        
        ```
        <dockerhub-username>/<repository-name>
        ```
        
    - Example:
        
        ```bash
        docker run mmsumshad/ansible-playable
        ```

---

### Summary of Common Commands

| Action | Command Example |
| --- | --- |
| Run a container | `docker run centos` |
| Run interactively | `docker run -it centos bash` |
| List running containers | `docker ps` |
| List all containers | `docker ps -a` |
| Stop a container | `docker stop <container-ID>` |
| Remove a container | `docker rm <container-ID>` |
| List images | `docker images` |
| Remove an image | `docker rmi <image-name>` |
| Pull an image manually | `docker pull <image-name>` |

---

#### Docker Run in Detail

##### 1. Running Specific Versions of Images (Tags)

- **Concept:**
    
    Docker images have different versions identified by **tags**.
    
- **Default Behavior:**
    - If you don't specify a tag, Docker pulls the image tagged as **`latest`**.
- **Command to run specific version:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run redis:4.0
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - `redis` = Image name
    - `4.0` = Specific version tag
    - `:` separates image name and version.
- **Where to find available tags:**
    - Visit **Docker Hub**.
    - Check under the image description for available tags.

---

##### 2. Running Containers in Interactive Mode

- **Problem:**
    
    By default, Docker containers **do not accept standard input** (non-interactive).
    
- **Solution: Use `i` for interactive mode**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -i <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - `i` keeps the standard input (stdin) open for the container even if not attached.

---

##### 3. Attaching a Terminal (Pseudo-TTY)

- **Problem:**
    
    Prompts (like "Enter your name:") **don't appear** without terminal attachment.
    
- **Solution: Use `t` to allocate a pseudo-TTY**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -t <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Interactive + Terminal together:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -it <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - `i` for interactive input
    - `t` for pseudo-terminal
    - `it` combines both for full interaction with the container.

---

##### 4. Port Mapping / Publishing Ports

- **Problem:**
    
    Container ports are **not directly accessible** from outside the Docker host.
    
- **Solution: Use `p` to map ports**
- **Command:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:5000 my-web-app
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - Maps port `5000` inside the container to port `80` on the Docker host.
    - Access app via `http://<Docker-host-IP>:80`.
- **Important Notes:**
    - **Container IP** (e.g., 172.17.0.2) is internal, only accessible inside Docker host.
    - **Docker Host IP** (e.g., 192.168.1.5) is external and can be used if port mapped.
    - **Cannot map the same host port** to multiple containers.
- **Multiple Applications Example:**
    - MySQL instance 1 ‚Üí Host port 3306 ‚Üí Container port 3306
    - MySQL instance 2 ‚Üí Host port 8306 ‚Üí Container port 3306

---

##### 5. Data Persistence Using Volumes

- **Problem:**
    
    If a container is deleted, **data inside it is lost**.
    
- **Solution: Use `v` to mount host directories**
- **Command:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v <host-dir>:<container-dir> <image-name>
    ```
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - Maps `/opt/data` on the host to `/var/lib/mysql` inside container.
    - Data stored in `/opt/data` **persists** even if the container is deleted.

---

##### 6. Viewing Detailed Container Information

- **Command:**
    
    ```bash
    docker inspect <container-id or container-name>
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - Displays detailed JSON output including:
        - State
        - Mounts
        - Network settings
        - Configuration details

---

##### 7. Viewing Container Logs

- **Command:**
    
    ```bash
    docker logs <container-id or container-name>
    ```
    
- **Explanation:**
    - Shows all standard output logs from a container.
    - Useful for containers running in **detached mode** (`d`).

---

## Dockerizing a Simple Python Flask Application

### Application Overview

This section demonstrates how to containerize a basic Python Flask web application using Docker. The application exposes two endpoints:

- `/` returns a "Welcome" message.
- `/how-are-you` returns "I'm good, how about you?"

You can find the implementation in:
- [my-simple-webapp-flask/app.py](my-simple-webapp-flask/app.py)
- [my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile](my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile)

---

### Manual Deployment Steps

To manually deploy the application on an Ubuntu host:

1. **Install Python**:
    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y python3
    ```

2. **Install pip**:
    ```bash
    apt-get install -y python3-pip
    ```

3. **Install Flask**:
    ```bash
    pip3 install flask
    ```

4. **Deploy the Application**:
    ```bash
    cp /path/to/app.py /opt/app.py
    flask --app /opt/app.py run --host=0.0.0.0
    ```

Once running, access the app at `http://<host-ip>:5000`.

---

### Dockerizing the Application

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:  
   The Dockerfile defines the steps to containerize the application:
   - Use the official Ubuntu image.
   - Install Python, pip, and Flask.
   - Copy `app.py` into the container.
   - Set the entrypoint to run the Flask app.

2. **Dockerfile Example** ([my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile](my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile)):
    ```docker
    FROM ubuntu

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-flask

    COPY app.py /opt/app.py

    ENTRYPOINT ["flask", "--app", "/opt/app.py", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    ```

#### Explanation:

- `FROM ubuntu`: Uses Ubuntu as the base image.
- `RUN ...`: Installs Python 3, pip, and Flask.
- `COPY app.py /opt/app.py`: Copies the application code.
- `ENTRYPOINT ...`: Runs the Flask app on container start.

---

### Build and Run the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image** (run in the [my-simple-webapp-flask](my-simple-webapp-flask/) directory):
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-simple-webapp .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-simple-webapp
    ```

3. **Access the Application**:
    - [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for the root endpoint.
    - [http://localhost:5000/how-are-you](http://localhost:5000/how-are-you) for the second endpoint.

---

### Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub

1. **Tag the Image**:
    ```bash
    docker tag my-simple-webapp yourdockerhubusername/my-simple-webapp
    ```

2. **Login to Docker Hub**:
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

3. **Push the Image**:
    ```bash
    docker push yourdockerhubusername/my-simple-webapp
    ```

4. **Pull the Image** (on any machine):
    ```bash
    docker pull yourdockerhubusername/my-simple-webapp
    ```

---

### Conclusion

This section covered:

1. Creating a simple Python Flask application ([my-simple-webapp-flask/app.py](my-simple-webapp-flask/app.py)).
2. Writing a Dockerfile to containerize it ([my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile](my-simple-webapp-flask/Dockerfile)).
3. Building and running the Docker image.
4. Pushing the image to Docker Hub for sharing and reuse.

Containerizing applications with Docker ensures consistent deployments across different environments.

## Environment Variables in Docker

- **Problem**:  
  Hardcoding configuration (like background color) in application code is bad practice.

- **Solution**:  
  Move dynamic values (like `APP_COLOR`) to **environment variables**.

- **How to set environment variables**:
    - During normal execution:
        ```bash
        export APP_COLOR=blue
        ```
    - During Docker container run:
        ```bash
        docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue image-name
        ```

- **Deploy multiple containers with different configurations**:  
  Set different `-e` values each time.

- **View environment variables of a running container**:
    ```bash
    docker inspect container-name
    ```
    Look under the **Config > Env** section.

---

## Commands, Arguments, and Entrypoints in Docker

### Understanding Container Lifecycle

- **Container behavior**:  
  A container **runs a process**. If the process ends, the container **stops**.

- **Example**:  
  Running `docker run ubuntu` without a command ‚Üí container exits immediately (default bash process tries to find a terminal, fails, and exits).

### CMD Instruction

- **CMD in Dockerfile**:  
  Specifies the default command for the container when it starts.

- **Example**:  
  Ubuntu image has CMD as `["bash"]`.

- **Override CMD during run**:
    ```bash
    docker run ubuntu sleep 5
    ```
    - Runs `sleep 5` instead of default `bash`.

- **Ways to write CMD**:
    - **Shell form**:
        ```
        CMD sleep 5
        ```
    - **Exec form (preferred)**:
        ```
        CMD ["sleep", "5"]
        ```

### ENTRYPOINT Instruction

- **ENTRYPOINT**:  
  Defines a **fixed executable** that **always runs** when the container starts.

- **Behavior**:
    - Command-line arguments during `docker run` are **appended** to ENTRYPOINT.
    - Unlike CMD, ENTRYPOINT is **not replaced** by command-line arguments.

- **Example** ([cmd-vs-entrypoint/Dockerfile](cmd-vs-entrypoint/Dockerfile)):
    ```
    ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
    CMD ["5"]
    ```
    - Default command: `sleep 5`
    - If you run:
        ```bash
        docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
        ```
        It runs: `sleep 10`

- **CMD provides default parameters** when none are passed at runtime.

### Overriding ENTRYPOINT at runtime

- **Use `--entrypoint` option**:
    ```bash
    docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
    ```
    - Changes executable from `sleep` to `sleep2.0`.

---

## Important Dockerfile Summary

| Dockerfile Instruction | Purpose | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CMD` | Default command | Replaced if user provides one in `docker run` |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Fixed executable | Arguments appended; executable stays the same |
| `CMD` + `ENTRYPOINT` | Together | ENTRYPOINT + CMD args at startup |

## Docker Compose

### üîß Docker Basics Recap

- Use `docker run` to start individual containers.
- For complex multi-service applications, use **Docker Compose** with a YAML configuration.

---

### üê≥ Sample Voting Application Stack (Used Throughout the Course)

#### Components

1. **Voting App (Python)**
    - Lets users vote between *cats* and *dogs*.
    - Votes stored temporarily in **Redis**.
2. **Worker (.NET)**
    - Fetches votes from Redis.
    - Updates final tally in **PostgreSQL**.
3. **Result App (Node.js)**
    - Reads tally from PostgreSQL.
    - Displays results via web UI.

#### Data Flow

User ‚ûù Voting App ‚ûù Redis ‚ûù Worker ‚ûù PostgreSQL ‚ûù Result App

---

### üê≥ Running Each Service via `docker run`

- **Redis:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name redis redis
    ```
- **PostgreSQL:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name db postgres
    ```
- **Voting App:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name vote -p 5000:80 vote-app
    ```
- **Result App:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name result -p 5001:80 result-app
    ```
- **Worker:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name worker worker-app
    ```

---

### üîó Container Communication Using `--link` (Deprecated)

- Use `--link` to allow inter-container communication by hostname.
    ```bash
    docker run --link redis:redis ...
    ```
    - Updates `/etc/hosts` with `redis` name pointing to container IP.
- **Worker needs links to both Redis and PostgreSQL.**

> **Note:** `--link` is deprecated. Docker Compose (v2+) with networking is preferred.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Docker Compose File (Basic Structure)

See: [example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml](example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml)

---

### üèóÔ∏è Key Docker Compose Concepts

- `services:` ‚Äì All containers go under this section (from v2 onwards).
- `build:` ‚Äì Specifies directory with Dockerfile to build image.
- `image:` ‚Äì For prebuilt/public images (like `redis`, `postgres`).
- `ports:` ‚Äì Host:Container port mappings.
- `depends_on:` ‚Äì Define startup order (e.g., vote depends on redis).

---

### üìÅ Build vs Pull

- Use `image:` if pulling from Docker Hub.
- Use `build:` if building from local directory with a Dockerfile.

---

### üåê Networking Differences

- **v1:** All containers attached to the default bridge network. Use `links`.
- **v2+:** Docker Compose creates a new bridge network automatically. Services can talk to each other using service names (no need for `links`).

---

### üßæ Docker Compose Versions Summary

| Feature | Version 1 | Version 2+ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File structure | Flat service definitions | Nested under `services:` |
| Networking | Default bridge + `links` | Automatic app-specific network |
| Startup order | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ `depends_on:` available |
| Version declaration | ‚ùå Not required | ‚úÖ `version: '2'` required |

---

## üß± Voting App Architecture

The Example Voting App is a **multi-tier application** with 5 main components:

| Component | Language / Tech | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vote` | Python + Flask | Frontend web app to cast votes (cats/dogs) |
| `redis` | Redis | Queue to temporarily store votes |
| `worker` | .NET | Pulls vote from Redis ‚Üí saves to Postgres |
| `db` (postgres) | PostgreSQL | Stores votes persistently |
| `result` | Node.js + Express | Displays voting results |

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- [`example-voting-app-main/vote/`](example-voting-app-main/vote/) ‚Üí Flask app (Python)
- [`example-voting-app-main/worker/`](example-voting-app-main/worker/) ‚Üí Worker app (.NET)

- [`example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml`](example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml), `stack.yml`

---

## üîÑ Flow of Data

1. User votes on `vote` app
2. Vote is pushed to **Redis**
3. `worker` fetches vote from Redis, inserts into **Postgres**
4. `result` app queries Postgres and displays the current tally

## üìñ Continuation: Running Voting App with Docker Compose

Now that we have individual services for the voting app, result app, worker, Redis, and Postgres, let's simplify everything using **Docker Compose**.

Instead of running each container manually, we'll describe everything in a single file called [`docker-compose.yml`](example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml). Docker Compose will take care of building images, creating containers, connecting them via networks, and managing their dependencies.

---

## üõ† [`docker-compose.yml`](example-voting-app-main/docker-compose.yml) file

```yaml
services:
  vote:
    build:
      context: ./vote
      target: dev
    depends_on:
      - redis
    volumes:
      - ./vote:/usr/local/app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - front-tier
      - back-tier

  result:
    build: ./result
    entrypoint: nodemon --inspect=0.0.0.0 server.js
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - ./result:/usr/local/app
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
      - "127.0.0.1:9229:9229"
    networks:
      - front-tier
      - back-tier

  worker:
    build:
      context: ./worker
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
    networks:
      - back-tier

```

## üß† Explanation of what's happening

| Service | Purpose | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vote` | Front-end Voting App (Python Flask) | Listens on port 8080, connects to Redis to store votes. Code mounted for live changes. |
| `result` | Results App (Node.js) | Listens on port 8081, connects to Postgres DB to read results. Uses `nodemon` for live reloading during development. |
| `worker` | Background Processor | Fetches votes from Redis and updates Postgres with the counted votes. |
| `redis` | In-memory Data Store | Temporary store for incoming votes. Very fast. |
| `db` | Database (Postgres) | Permanent store for final vote counts. |
| `seed` | (Optional) Seed Data Generator | Populates the app with some initial data, runs once if you specify the `seed` profile manually. |

Two separate **networks** are used:

- `front-tier`: For communication between front-end apps and Redis.
- `back-tier`: For communication between worker, Redis, and database.

The `db-data` **volume** ensures that Postgres data persists even if the container is restarted.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

Simply run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You should start seeing all services starting up in the logs.

---

## üåê Access the Voting Application

- Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
    - Here, you can **cast your vote** (for example, "Cats" vs "Dogs").
- Then open another tab: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)
    - Here, you can **see the real-time voting results** updating.

---

## üìã Summary of this step

- Used `docker-compose.yml` to define everything needed.
- One command (`docker compose up`) to build and start everything.
- Voting UI available at **localhost:8080**.
- Results available at **localhost:8081**.
- Live code reloading if you change Python or Node.js code (because of volumes + dev settings).

---

## üê≥ Docker Registry

---

### üîç What is a Docker Registry?

- A **Docker Registry** is a **central repository** for storing Docker images.
- Think of it as the **"cloud"** from which containers **(the "rain")** are pulled.
- Default public registry: **Docker Hub** (`docker.io`).
- Contains official, verified, and user-contributed images.

---

### üì¶ Image Naming Convention

Docker images follow this naming structure:

```
[registry-hostname/][username-or-org/]repository[:tag]
```

#### Examples:

| Image | Full Name | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nginx` | `docker.io/library/nginx` | `library` indicates it's an **official image** on Docker Hub. |
| `myuser/myapp` | `docker.io/myuser/myapp` | Image under the **Docker Hub account `myuser`**. |
| `localhost:5000/myimage` | `localhost:5000/myimage` | **Private registry** running on the same machine. |

---

### üîÑ Pulling & Running Images

- Command:
    
    ```bash
    docker run nginx
    ```
    
- This pulls the image `nginx` from the default registry (`docker.io/library/nginx`) and runs it.
- If no registry is specified, Docker assumes it's from Docker Hub.

---

### üß≥ Pushing & Pulling from Registries

#### Public Registries

- **Popular Registries**:
    - Docker Hub: `docker.io`
    - Google Container Registry: `gcr.io`
    - GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io`
- These allow public access and can be used for CI/CD and deployments.

#### Private Registries

- For internal or enterprise use.
- Can be:
    - Hosted yourself using the Docker Registry image.
    - Provided by cloud providers like:
        - AWS (ECR)
        - Azure (ACR)
        - Google Cloud (GCR private)

---

### üîê Using Private Registries

#### 1. Login

```bash
docker login <registry-url>
```

- Enter your **username** and **password/token**.

#### 2. Pull/Push Image

```bash
docker pull <registry-url>/<repo>:<tag>
docker push <registry-url>/<repo>:<tag>
```

If you're not logged in, you'll get an **"image not found"** or **unauthorized** error.

---

### üè† Hosting Your Own Private Registry

#### Run Docker Registry Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry
```

- Pulls the `registry` image.
- Exposes the Docker Registry API on **port 5000**.

#### Tag and Push Image

```bash
docker tag myimage localhost:5000/myimage
docker push localhost:5000/myimage
```

#### Pull From It Later

- On same host:
    
    ```bash
    docker pull localhost:5000/myimage
    ```
    
- On another host:
    
    ```bash
    docker pull <host-ip>:5000/myimage
    ```
    

üìù Note: You may need to configure Docker daemon to allow **insecure registries** if using HTTP.

---

### üß™ Practice

- Try setting up your **own registry** on port `5000`.
- Build and tag a custom image.
- Push it to the local registry.
- Pull and run it on another host (or from the same host).

---

## üß† Docker Engine Architecture

#### üîß Components

When Docker is installed on a Linux host, the following components are set up:

1. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**
    - Background service.
    - Manages Docker objects: images, containers, volumes, networks.
    - Listens for Docker API requests.
2. **Docker REST API**
    - Interface for interacting with the daemon programmatically.
    - Allows external tools or scripts to manage Docker.
3. **Docker CLI**
    - Command-line interface used to issue commands (e.g., `docker run`, `docker stop`).
    - Internally communicates with the Docker daemon via REST API.

> üí° CLI can be remote: You can run the Docker CLI on a separate machine and connect to a remote Docker Engine using:
> 

```bash
docker -H <remote-host-ip>:2375 run nginx
```

---

### üß± How Docker Containers Achieve Isolation

Docker relies on **Linux kernel features** to isolate containers:

#### üîí Namespaces

- Namespaces provide isolation for:
    - **PID (Process IDs)**
    - **Network**
    - **Mounts**
    - **IPC (Inter-process communication)**
    - **UTS (hostname/timezone)**

#### ‚ûï Example: PID Namespace

- On host boot, the first process has PID `1`.
- All further processes get unique PIDs (`2, 3, ...`).
- When a container is started:
    - Its main process also has PID `1` *inside the container*.
    - On the host, this process may have PID `5000`, for example.
    - Same process ‚Üí two PIDs:
        - One in the host namespace (`5000`)
        - One in the container namespace (`1`)

```bash
# Inside the container
ps aux        # shows nginx PID as 1

# On the host
ps aux | grep nginx   # shows nginx PID as e.g., 5000
```

This gives the illusion of full independence for the container.

---

### üß† Resource Management

By default, **containers can use all available CPU and memory**, which may starve the host or other containers.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Control Groups (cgroups)

Docker uses **cgroups** to manage and limit resource usage.

#### üßÆ CPU Limits

```bash
docker run --cpus=".5" nginx
```

- Limits container to **50% of CPU**.

#### üß† Memory Limits

```bash
docker run --memory="100m" nginx
```

- Limits container to **100 MB of RAM**.

These options help prevent a single container from consuming excessive resources.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Docker Engine = Daemon + REST API + CLI
- Containers are **isolated via namespaces** (e.g., PID namespace tricks container into thinking it has its own PID `1`).
- **Control groups (cgroups)** manage how much **CPU and memory** a container can use.
- **Docker CLI can work remotely** using `H <host>:port`.
- All containers share the host's OS kernel, but think they‚Äôre independent due to namespace isolation.

---

## Docker PID

#### üîç Step-by-Step:

1. **Search for `tomcat`** on Docker Hub.
2. **Use an image run command with port mapping**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8888:8080 tomcat
    ```
    
    - Maps container‚Äôs port `8080` to host‚Äôs port `8888`.
    - Runs in foreground, shows Tomcat startup logs.
3. **Access Tomcat Web UI**:
    - Open browser to `http://<host-ip>:8888`
    - Confirms container is running.
4. **Stop container (if foreground)**:
    - Use `Ctrl + C`.
5. **Run container in background**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8888:8080 tomcat
    ```
    
    - `d` runs in detached mode (background).
6. **Verify running container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    
    - Confirms Tomcat container is active.

---

### üîç Inspecting Processes Inside the Container

1. **Run command inside container**:
    
    ```bash
    docker exec <container_id> ps -eaf
    ```
    
    - Lists all processes in the container.
    - Tomcat runs as PID `1` inside the container.
2. **Verify process on the Docker host**:
    
    ```bash
    ps -eaf | grep java
    ```
    
    - Same process appears with a different PID (e.g., `3250`).
    - Confirms that it's the same process with two different PIDs due to namespace isolation.

---

### üîí Key Concept: PID Namespace

- **Inside the container**: Process has PID `1` ‚Üí appears as root process.
- **On the host**: Same process has a different PID (e.g., `3250`).
- **Namespace allows one process to have different PIDs** depending on context:
    - Isolated inside container.
    - Mapped differently on host.
- This is a core mechanism behind Docker's container isolation.

---

## üì¶ Docker Image & Container Storage Architecture

### üîπ Layered Architecture of Docker Images

- Docker builds images **layer by layer**, where **each instruction** in the `Dockerfile` creates a **new image layer**.
- **Each layer contains only the changes** made from the previous one.

**Example Layers:**
1. `FROM ubuntu` ‚Üí base layer (~120 MB)
2. `RUN apt-get install` ‚Üí APT packages (~300 MB)
3. `RUN pip install flask` ‚Üí Python packages
4. `COPY . /app` ‚Üí Application source code
5. `ENTRYPOINT` ‚Üí Entry point of app
- Layers are **cached and reused** if unchanged, which:
    - **Speeds up builds**
    - **Saves disk space**

### üîπ Layer Reuse Example

- If two apps use:
    - The **same base image**
    - **Same dependencies**, but **different source code**

‚Üí Docker reuses **common layers** from the cache and **only rebuilds the differing ones** (e.g., app code, entrypoint).

### üîπ Image Layers Are Read-Only

- Once built, image layers are **immutable (read-only)**.
- Changes to these require **a rebuild** (`docker build`).

---

### üê≥ Containers and the Writable Layer

#### üîπ What Happens on `docker run`

- Docker **adds a writable container layer** on top of the image.
- This writable layer is:
    - **Read-Write**
    - **Ephemeral** (deleted when the container is removed)

#### üîπ Copy-on-Write Mechanism

- If a file in the image is modified inside a container:
    - Docker **copies it** from the image to the container‚Äôs **writable layer**
    - Edits happen **only** on this copy
- The **image layer remains untouched**

#### üîπ Writable Layer Stores:

- Logs
- Temp files
- App-generated files
- User-modified files (e.g., creating `temp.txt` inside the container)

#### üîπ Data Loss Warning

- **Destroying the container** = **losing all writable layer data**

---

#### üíæ Persisting Data with Volumes and Mounts

#### üîπ Volume Mounting (Managed by Docker)

- Create a Docker-managed volume:
    
    ```bash
    docker volume create data_volume
    ```
    
- Mount it to a container:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
    ```
    
- Volume stored at: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
- Data **persists** even if the container is deleted.

#### üîπ Auto Volume Creation

- If you run:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v data_volume2:/var/lib/mysql mysql
    ```
    
    without pre-creating `data_volume2`, Docker **auto-creates it**.
    

#### üîπ Bind Mounting (Host-controlled)

- Used when data exists on host at a specific path:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql
    ```
    
- **Mounts existing host directory** (`/data/mysql`) into container.
- Offers **more control**, but **less isolation**.

---

#### üÜï `-mount` Syntax (Modern Recommended Style)

#### üîπ Format:

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql \
  mysql
```

- More **explicit and readable**
- Parameters:
    - `type` = `bind` or `volume`
    - `source` = path on host or volume name
    - `target` = path inside container

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Storage Drivers: The Backend Mechanism

#### üîπ Role of Storage Drivers

- Implement Docker‚Äôs layered filesystem
- Handle:
    - Layer stacking
    - Writable layers
    - Copy-on-write

#### üîπ Common Storage Drivers:

| Driver | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **AUFS** | Default on Ubuntu; supports layering well |
| **overlay2** | Preferred for most modern distros; fast and stable |
| **Btrfs** | Advanced FS features (snapshots, quotas); needs Btrfs support |
| **ZFS** | Rich features but heavy and complex |
| **Device Mapper** | Supported on RHEL/CentOS; slower but stable |
- Docker **auto-selects** the best available driver for your OS.

---

#### üîö Summary

- Docker **builds images in layers**: efficient, cacheable, and read-only.
- Containers get a **writable layer** on top of the image.
- To **persist data**, use **volumes or bind mounts**.
- Under the hood, **storage drivers** manage the layered architecture and performance characteristics.

---

### üìÅ Docker File System: Where and How Data is Stored

#### üìå Default Storage Path

- When Docker is installed, it **creates a default storage directory**:
    
    ```
    /var/lib/docker
    ```
    
- Inside this directory, Docker **manages all data** related to:
    - Images
    - Containers
    - Layers
    - Networks
    - Volumes
    - Plugins

#### üìÇ Key Directories Inside `/var/lib/docker`

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `containers/` | Metadata and filesystem data for running and stopped containers |
| `image/` | Image data (can vary by storage driver used) |
| `network/` | Network configuration and bridge networks |
| `plugins/` | Plugin files |
| `swarm/` | Swarm-specific data if Docker Swarm mode is used |
| `aufs/` (or `overlay2/`) | Stores layered filesystems (depends on storage driver) |

---

## üß± Storage Drivers

#### üîß What is a Storage Driver?

- Responsible for **managing image layers and container filesystems**.
- It controls how Docker **creates, stores, and mounts** these layers.

#### üöÄ Checking the Storage Driver

- Use `docker info` to view current storage driver.
    
    ```
    docker info
    ```
    
- Example output:
    
    ```
    Storage Driver: aufs
    Root Dir: /var/lib/docker/aufs
    ```
    

#### üìÇ AUFS Folder Structure

When using the **AUFS** storage driver, Docker creates:

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `diff/` | Contains **actual contents of each layer** (each layer is a folder) |
| `layers/` | Stores **metadata** describing how layers stack on top of each other |
| `mnt/` | Stores **mount points** for containers |

---

## üëã Example 1: Pulling a Docker Image (`hello-world`)

#### üß∞ Steps:

1. Pull the image:
    
    ```
    docker pull hello-world
    ```
    
2. View image:
    
    ```
    docker images
    ```
    
3. Explore file system:
    
    ```
    cd /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff
    ls
    ```
    

#### üßæ What You'll Find:

- A **folder with a random hash name** inside `diff/` containing a file named `hello`
- This file is the actual script that prints the "Hello from Docker!" message

#### üìú Docker History Command

- View how the image was built:
    
    ```
    docker history hello-world
    ```
    

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Example 2: Building a Custom Flask Web App Image

#### üìÅ Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Flask application
- **`Dockerfile`**:
    
    ```
    FROM ubuntu
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
    COPY requirements.txt /tmp/
    RUN pip3 install -r /tmp/requirements.txt
    COPY app.py /opt/
    CMD ["python3", "/opt/app.py"]
    ```
    

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Image

```bash
docker build -t simple-web-app .
```

#### üêã What Happens:

- Docker **pulls base image (Ubuntu)**.
- Installs **Python + pip**.
- Installs **app dependencies** via `pip`.
- Copies the app source code into `/opt/`.
- Sets the **entry point** to run Flask.

---

## ‚ö° Build Caching and Layer Reuse

#### üîÅ Rebuilding the Same Dockerfile

- On second build with no changes:
    - Docker reuses **cached layers**.
    - Build finishes in **1 second** instead of minutes.
    - Example output shows: `Using cache`.

#### üßæ Docker History of Custom Image

- View build steps and layer sizes:
    
    ```
    docker history simple-web-app
    ```
    
- Example output:
    - Ubuntu base: ~100MB
    - Python dependencies: ~366MB
    - App copy: a few KB

---

## üìÇ Inspecting AUFS Layer Contents

#### Navigate to Docker storage:

```bash
cd /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff
```

#### Use `du -sh *` to see sizes:

- Helps identify which layer corresponds to:
    - Python libraries (e.g., 376MB)
    - Ubuntu base (e.g., 100MB)
    - App code (e.g., 12KB)

#### üîç Locate and Inspect App Layer:

```bash
cd <small-folder>
ls
cat app.py
```

- Confirms your source code is **copied into a layer** as per Dockerfile instruction.

---

## üìà Layer Optimization Insight

- Docker layers are **built in order** as per Dockerfile.
- **Unchanged steps** are reused via **layer cache**.
- If only **source code changes**, only the `COPY` layer and layers above are rebuilt.
